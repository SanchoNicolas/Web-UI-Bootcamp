# Web-UI-Bootcamp
Just a compilation of useful information and some exercises that will help you throw this path of learning how to code.


Here we can make all the learning path more clear and try to follow up.

# First of all
You should seek information about this page.
 ```bash 
  What is Git?
  What is GitHub?
  How is the flow that is used with this tool?
```
Few links that may come in handly:
```bash

  Practic introduction to git & github: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udughzlN5M4 
```
We will use Github to share our work and compare, it's important for you to now 
Git if you are looking to get a job as a software developer, you won't find a job
that skips GIT, it's super important that you get the hang of it.

After you feel confortable with this tool you should clone this repository on an 
empty folder and you can start testing some stuff.
i would like you to do some steps in order to show what you have learned.

```bash 
Inside of the folder that get's created after you clone this repo you should create 
a file (this could be a .txt file or if you feel like it, you can create an .html file) 
with something inside, it doesn't really matter what you put on in for now.

After that, you should create a new branch on this repository (git checkout -n nameOfYourBranch) 
and commit those changes to that branch (in order to make a commit remember that you have to run 
"git add ." to get your changes to staging area. You should run "git commit -m yourCommitMessageHere" 
to commit your changes to your remote repo).

Then all you have to do is push this changes onto the git repository using "git push".
it is possible that you face an issue when pushing since that branc is created on your remote repository
but not on github. If you get an error after hiting "git push" you only have to copy/paste the command 
that the console will advise you to use. Something like "git push --set upstream . .. . . ." you just 
copy that and execute it.
```
With this, you just made your first changes on github!! 

But now, lets make some changes on that file of yours to see how it behaves.
Git will keep track of everything you do on that folder, in order to see what changed you can simply 
type "git status" to see which changes you have done recently on your local repository and it will tell 
you which ones of them are on stagin state and which ones are waiting for you to add them.

```bash
 Go to your file and change something, you can change a line, add one or delete one, it really doesn't matter.
 Save those changes and run the script that i mentioned above.

 Now that you have new changes and saved them, git should be able to track those changes. Please follow the 
 process that you need in order to push those changes to your branch.
 REMEMBER: You already created a branch so the step about "git checkout -b" should be ignored for this.
```

If you feel like searching all the history of that branch you can type "git log" or "git log -p" to see it prettier
this will show you all the commits that were made on that branch.

This will be the flow that we will follow on this Bootcamp, everytime you do some changes or add some files you should 
push them on your branch so i can review and we can have conversation about differents approaches.


# HTML

First of all let put this clear for you: HTML is not a programming languaje.
It's your turn to search some info here:
```bash
 What is HTML?
 How can we create an HTML file and see his content on our browser?
 Which ones are the most common HTML tags?
```
some links that can help you:
What is HTML: https://desarrolloweb.com/articulos/que-es-html.html
a good course here,, follow those videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqMfPS8jPys&t=370s
* Here you have some tasks to do on HTML that i'll like yo see on your branch to review:

```bash
 Create an HTML file called "index.html".
On this file i will like you to create the following:
Create a title, create a paraph, put a title to the page, create an order list, unorder list and a link.
Push this changes to your branch so i can review them.
```
